{"name":"VanillaAPI","tagline":"Highly extensible RESTful API for Vanilla. Still undergoing development","body":"# Vanilla API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kasperisager/VanillaAPI.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kasperisager/VanillaAPI) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/kasperisager/VanillaAPI.png)](https://gemnasium.com/kasperisager/VanillaAPI)\r\n\r\nA super early version of a RESTful API for Vanilla that responds in JSON and XML.\r\n\r\n> #### Notice\r\n> The Vanilla API is still undergoing heavy development and gets rewritten every so often. Do therefore __not__ use it for __anything__ just yet. You're more than welcome to take a look at the source though and any contribution would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nTo get started using Vanilla API, either:\r\n- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/kasperisager/VanillaAPI/archive/master.zip)\r\n- Clone the repository directly into your Vanilla `applications` directory:  \r\n`$ cd /path/to/vanilla/applications/`  \r\n`$ git clone git://github.com/kasperisager/VanillaAPI.git`\r\n\r\nNow simply go to your Vanilla dashboard, enable Vanilla API in the \"Applications\" menu and you're all set!\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nVanilla API is in fact not an API in itself. A more fitting description would be that it's a mapper tool whose purpose is to implement a RESTful URI scheme upon with you can invoke different methods using the standard GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP verbs. It also translates PUT and DELETE requests into POST requests so that Garden can understand and process these.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you can look at Vanilla API as being an application that sits of top of the default API, translating and handling different requests for use by the application and core controllers who in return carry out the actual methods.\r\n\r\n## Issue tracking\r\n\r\nIf you come across any bugs or if you have a feature request, please [file an issue](https://github.com/kasperisager/VanillaAPI/issues) using the Github Issue tracker. Vanilla API won't be supported through http://vanillaforums.org so please stick to using Github for inquires about bugs and feature requests. Thanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\nCopyright 2013 Â© [Kasper K.
